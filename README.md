# ninetyone_techinal_assesment

To run this project succesfully, make sure you have installed all packages and versions as specified in the requirements.txt

The portfolio_utils.py file was created with the intention of being its own mini-package with all functions and class's neccassary to create all the output needed to perform return, risk and ESG analysis on the given portfolio. Unfortunately in the absense of more of time, this file got a bit messy but it is still fit for purpose.
